# Abstract to model on
Purpose: Soccer participation continues to increase among all ages in the US. Our objective was to analyze trends in soccer-related facial injury epidemiology, demographics, and mechanisms of injury.

Materials and methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was evaluated for soccer-related facial injuries from 2010 through 2014. Results for product code "soccer" were filtered for injures to the face. Number of injuries was extrapolated, and data were analyzed for age, sex, specific injury diagnoses, locations, and mechanisms.

Results: In all, 2054 soccer-related facial trauma entries were analyzed. During this time, the number of injures remained relatively stable. Lacerations were the most common diagnosis (44.2%), followed by contusions and fractures. The most common sites of fracture were the nose (75.1%). Of fractures with a reported mechanism of injury, the most common was head-to-head collisions (39.0%). Patients <19 years accounted for 66.9% of injuries, and athletes over 18 years old had a higher risk of fractures.

Conclusions: The incidence of soccer-related facial trauma has remained stable, but the severity of such injuries remain a danger. Facial protection in soccer is virtually absent, and our findings reinforce the need to educate athletes, families, and physicians on injury awareness and prevention.

Keywords: NEISS; National Electronic Injury Surveillance System; facial trauma; soccer; soccer-related injury.

# Materials and Methods
The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a nationwide resource offered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, was evaluated for emergency department (ED) visits related to poisoning of birth control tablets. The NEISS collects data from a representative sample of EDs and weighs results based on ED setting, providing weighted national incidence. This database has been of great importance in numerous prior analyses.(citation needed)

In August 2020, the most recent 10-year period of data was searched using the product of interest “tablets” (NEISS code 1931) with focus on "poisoning" (NEISS code 68) of birth control. Data were recorded and evaluated for patient age, sex, injury type, and a brief narrative description of the incident. Injuries unrelated to ingestion of birth control were excluded from the study (e.g., patient on birth control and developed a pulmonary embolism). This database provided annual sample sizes as well as derived national estimates for poisoning due to tablet medications. The annual sample size of poisonings by tablet was multiplied by the annual percentage of birth-control related poisonings, and this proportion was multiplied by the nationwide estimate to come up with specific values for poisoning incidence. For example, the NEISS reported nine birth control-related ED visits for poisoning in 2019 with 882 poisonings via tablet medications in 2019 within the NEISS EDs.  Therefore (9/882) one percent of poisonings with tablets were from birth control.  In 2019, the poisoning with tablets had a derived estimate of 25,508 nationwide ED visits. Because one percent of these 882 visits (1%) were related to birth control, we multiplied 25,508 by one percent to come up with a national estimate of 255 birth control related poisonings for 2019. In addition to annual estimates, we also analyzed data by patient demographics (including age and gender), injury diagnosis, and patient disposition. We examined data from the most recent available 10-year block (2010–2019). 

Statistical Analysis
Fisher’s exact test and 2-tailed Student’s t test were used for comparison of categorical and continuous variables, as appropriate, with significance set at P < .05. Exploratory.io version 6.1.1.4 was used for statistical calculations.

Ethical Considerations
Because this study is comprised solely of publicly searchable data freely available through online databases, it qualifies as nonhuman subject research and thus was exempted from requiring institutional review board approval.

# Results
Over the 10-year period from 2010 to 2019, there were an estimated 323,597 poisonings described from tablet medications.  Of those 3,236 ED visits for birth control poisoning was estimated using our sample size of 73 patients. Assessing the entire 10-year period (2010−2019), we found a statistically significant, overall decreasing linear trend of birth control poisonings (p<0.05, Figure 1).  The majority of patients poisoned by birth control were male children  between the ages of 1 and 4 years old (74.4%) with the route of exposure always being ingestion.  A total of 404 (65.8%) patients in the sample studied were male, and the remainder (34.2%) of 210 patients were female.  While the majority of poisoning cases were treated and released from the hospital, 4.1% were admitted (Figure 4). Upon organizing the data we noted that patients ingested between one and and eighteen birth control pills prior to visiting the emergency department.  Dosage of the tablets ingested was not available for any of the cases.  Children acquired the tablets by picking them up when the tablets were spilled or chewing through the packaging the majority of the time.  In less than four percent of cases it could be determined if the placebo or active medication tablets were ingested.  Almost all of the poisoning occured from the patient's mother's birth control prescription.  In three percent of cases a sibling was present who had also eaten the birth control tablets.  There were no stastical differences in age, race, or sex regarding those who ingested birth control tablets (p>0.05 for all, figure 2, figure 3).  Visits to the ED for this issue occurred most often on a weekend during the summer months.  No deaths were reported.

Prior to 2019, each NEISS record allowed a maximum of one diagnosis, one body part, and two product codes. In 2019 the NEISS began collecting up to two diagnoses and body parts, and three product codes per record. As a result, a NEISS record may be counted multiple times in producing national injury estimates and calculating variability of those estimates. A single record may be counted in up to three product groups, product sub-groups, or individual product codes. Likewise, an individual NEISS record may be counted in up to two different diagnosis/body part combinations.
