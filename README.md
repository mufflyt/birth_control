# Abstract
Purpose: Oral contraceptive are one of the most common birth control methods. Our objective was to analyze trends in birth control tablet-related poisoning epidemiology, demographics, and mechanisms of injury.

Materials and methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was evaluated for birth control tablet-related poisonings from 2010 through 2019. Results for product code "medication tablets" were filtered for poisoning injuries. Number of poisonings was extrapolated, and data were analyzed for age, sex, specific poisoning diagnoses, locations, and mechanisms.

Results: In all, 73 birth control tablet-related poisoning entries were analyzed. Assessing the entire 10-year period (2010−2019), we found a statistically significant, overall decreasing linear trend of birth control poisonings (p<0.05).  The majority of patients poisoned by birth control were male children between the ages of 1 and 4 years old (74.4%) with the route of exposure always being ingestion.  There were no stastical differences in age, race, or sex regarding those who ingested birth control tablets (p>0.05 for all).  

Conclusions: The incidence of birth control-related poisoning has remained stable. Childproof packing and prevention of access to birth control pills is virtually absent, and our findings reinforce the need to educate patients, families, and physicians on injury awareness and prevention.

Keywords: NEISS; National Electronic Injury Surveillance System; poisoning; birth control tablet-related injury.

# Introduction: 
Accidental ingestion of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) is a commonly reported problem in emergency rooms.1,2 Oral contraceptive pills are a very commonly used medication, used by over 9.5 million women in the United States in 2014.5 Oral contraceptive pills can be used for a variety of conditions; benefits of oral contraceptive pills range from preventing pregnancy to reducing risk of ovarian cancer. Despite these benefits, poisoning with combined OCPs has been described in historical and contemporary literature. (PLEASE ADD CITATION). The first report about accidental ingestion of OCPs was in 1965, which was a report of nine cases of children 17 months – six years of age who had ingested norethindrone with mestranol tablets – with a much higher hormone levels than today’s OCPs.1 In those cases, there were no short or long term consequences were observed.1 Many of the poisoned children had gastric lavage performed within two hours of ingestion.1Another report reviewed 1,982 accidental ingestions of oral prescription drugs involving children under five in 1986, and found that 200 of these reports (10%) were ingestion of oral contraceptive pills, tied with analgesics for second most commonly ingested medication in the setting of poisoning. For all accidental ingestions investigated, the children were most often at home when ingestion occurred (82%), and the child’s mother was most often the intended user of the medication (27%).2 Ten percent of the medications overall and 30% of the oral contraceptive pills specifically were stored in a purse. An Australian study published in 2009 prospectively studied cases of OCP ingestion reported to Poison Information Centers. Sixty-three cases had complete follow up for the next five months after the incident.3 The median number of pills ingested was five (IQR ???- ???). 3 Minor symptoms including vomiting and irritability were reported in 44% of cases. 3 No case of vaginal bleeding was reported. 3 The overall conclusion of the study was that no major clinical effects seem to be associated from OCP ingestion among children. 3  Our objective was to analyze trends in birth control tablet-related poisoning epidemiology, demographics, and mechanisms of injury using a retrospective study design.

# Materials and Methods
The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a nationwide resource offered by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), was evaluated for emergency department (ED) visits related to poisoning of birth control tablets. The NEISS collects data from a representative sample of EDs providing weighted national incidence. Specifically, the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) provides timely data on consumer product-related injuries treated in hospital emergency departments in the United States. The Consumer Product Safety Commission also uses the NEISS system to collect information on childhood poisonings, in accordance with the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.(CITATION NEEDED) Coding and reporting records that involve consumer products or other injuries takes about 2 minutes per record. Coding and reporting additional special study information (Adverse Drug Effects) takes about two minutes.  The smallest hospital reported 82 cases with a burden of about 258 hours, while the largest hospital reported 47,801 cases with a burden of about 4,125 hours. This database has been of great importance in numerous prior analyses.(6-15)

In August 2020, the most recent 10-year period of data was searched using the product of interest “tablets” (NEISS code 1931) with focus on "poisoning" (NEISS code 68) of birth control. Data were recorded and evaluated for patient age, sex, injury type, and a brief narrative description of the incident. Injuries unrelated to ingestion of birth control were excluded from the study (e.g., patient on birth control and developed a pulmonary embolism). This database provided annual sample sizes as well as derived national estimates for poisoning due to tablet medications. The annual sample size of poisonings by tablet was multiplied by the annual percentage of birth-control related poisonings, and this proportion was multiplied by the nationwide estimate to come up with specific values for poisoning incidence. For example, the NEISS reported nine birth control-related ED visits for poisoning in 2019 with 882 poisonings via tablet medications in 2019 within the NEISS EDs.  Therefore (9/882) one percent of poisonings with tablets were from birth control.  In 2019, the poisoning with tablets had a derived estimate of 25,508 nationwide ED visits. Because one percent of these 882 visits (1%) were related to birth control, we multiplied 25,508 by one percent to come up with a national estimate of 255 birth control related poisonings for 2019. In addition to annual estimates, we also analyzed data by patient demographics (including age and gender), injury diagnosis, and patient disposition. We examined data from the most recent available 10-year block (2010–2019). 

Statistical Analysis
Fisher’s exact test and 2-tailed Student’s t test were used for comparison of categorical and continuous variables, as appropriate, with significance set at p < .05. Exploratory.io version 6.1.1.4 was used for statistical calculations.  Because this study is comprised solely of publicly searchable data freely available through online databases, it qualifies as non-human subject research and thus was exempted from requiring institutional review board approval.

# Results
Over the 10-year period from 2010 to 2019, there were an estimated 323,597 poisonings described from tablet medications.  Of those 3,236 ED visits for birth control poisoning was estimated using our sample size of 73 patients. Assessing the entire 10-year period (2010−2019), we found an overall decreasing linear trend of birth control poisonings (p<0.05, Figure 1).  The majority of patients poisoned by birth control were male children  between the ages of one and four years old (74.4%) with the route of exposure always being ingestion.  A total of 404 (65.8%) patients in the sample studied were male, and the remainder (34.2%) of 210 patients were female.  While the majority of poisoning cases were treated and released from the hospital, 4.1% were admitted (Figure 4). Upon organizing the data we noted that patients ingested between one and and eighteen birth control pills prior to visiting the emergency department.  Dosage of the tablets ingested was not available for any of the cases.  Children acquired the tablets by picking them up when the tablets were spilled or chewing through the packaging the majority of the time.  In less than four percent of cases it could be determined if the placebo or active medication tablets were ingested.  Almost all of the poisoning occured from the patient's mother's birth control prescription.  In three percent of cases a sibling was present who had also eaten the birth control tablets.  There were no stastical differences in age, race, or sex regarding those who ingested birth control tablets (p>0.05 for all, figure 2, figure 3).  Visits to the ED for this issue occurred most often on a weekend during the summer months.  No deaths were reported.

# Discussion
While prior studies of birth control-related poisonings provide valuable data, it is to the best of our knowledge that no recent studies have focused on birth control-related poisonings presenting to US emergency departments, nor have studies specifically characterized details of these poisonings. This study demonstrates that there are hundreds of thousands of estimated emergency department visits due to birth control poisonings. Although numerous reports note that contraception with combined oral contraceptive pills continues to grow in the US, our data suggest that the number of birth control-related poisonings presenting to emergency departments has remained relatively stable over the last ten years.(CITE THE "numerous reports") Luckily, poisonings with birth control tablets do not have long-lasting physiological impacts on young children.(CITE PLEASE)  

Although the vast majority of patients were released after examination, the authors would be remiss not to mention the importance of rapidly identifying and attempting to remove any birth control from a child's reach. Storage of medications in places such as locked cabinets are helpful to prevent accidental ingestions. Additionally, it may be wise for healthcare providers, including gynecologists, to counsel parents regarding the importance of keeping medication out of reach for children. Other medications that gynecologists use such as boric acid suppositories or ???? can also have fatal effects if swallowed.  We recommend that product manufacterers also work towards creating OCP packaging that is not appealing to children for birth control. 

A strength of the current study is that it investigates a commonly used medication that is frequently seen for accidental ingestion in the emergency department. Additionally, NEISS data has been used over the last decade and has been validated in other papers. Although this analysis comprehensively details nationally representative patterns of patient presentation and poisoning patterns for individuals, it is not without significant limitations.  Importantly, many patients with poisoning may present in other settings not encompassed by the NEISS, such as ambulatory care centers and outpatient clinical offices.  Hence, some of our estimates may potentially underestimate the extent to which poisoning of children occurs from birth control.  Furthermore, although the use of a nationally representative resource has considerable strength with regard to external validity and the applicability of data, this resource is inadequate for evaluation of management, severity of poisoning, type of treatment required, complications of treatment and outcomes, as available data are focused on presentation, patient, and injury characteristics.  Consequently, an intra-institutional or multi-institutional investigation of individual patient data may be a valuable complement to findings reported. 

The number of birth control-related poisonings in the US has been stable since 2010. It is apparent that birth control-related poisoning is serious and warrants awareness by all physicians, including gynecologists, of mechanisms, appropriate counseling to patients, proper treatment, and continued investigation on injury prevention.
